===========
South 0.7.6
===========

This is a minor new release of South, and the sixth bugfix release for the 
:ref:`0.7 series <0-7-release-notes>`.

Major changes are outlined below. A full list of bugs fixed can be found on the
South Trac.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None.


--update
========

There is now a new ``--update`` switch, which you can use with ``schemamigration``
to merge updates you've just done into your most recent migration and then
reverse and re-apply that migration to the database.

Note that this will only work with migrations that aren't yet committed into
a VCS - once that occurs, you should create a new migration rather than
running ``--update`` on the current one.


Table defaults
==============

South now keeps all defaults out of the database during table creation, to 
mirror Django's approach when creating tables. This was already the case when
adding columns.


SQLite fixes
============

The SQLite backend now correctly handles boolean default values.


MSSQL fixes
===========

Altering ForeignKey columns now works correctly.


Firebird fixes
==============

Boolean defaults and autoincrement now works correctly.
